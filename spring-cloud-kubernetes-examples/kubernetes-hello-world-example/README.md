# Setting up the Environment

To play with these examples, you can install locally Kubernetes & Docker using [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) within a Virtual Machine
managed by a hypervisor (Xhyve, Virtualbox or KVM) if your machine is not a native Unix operating system.

  
When the minikube is installed on your machine, you can start kubernetes using this command:
```
minikube start
```

You also probably want to configure your Docker client to point the minikube Docker daemon with:
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

This will make sure the Docker images that you build are available to the minikube environment.

# Hello World Example

This Spring Boot application exposes an endpoint that we can call to receive a `Hello World` message as response. The application is configured using the 
@RestController, and the method returning the message is annotated with `@RequestMapping("/")`.

The uberjar of the Spring Boot application is packaged within a Docker image using the [Fabric8 Maven plugin](https://maven.fabric8.io) and next deployed top of the Kubernetes management platform as a pod 
using the replication controller created by the plugin.


Once you have the environment set up (minikube or kubectl configured against a kubernetes cluster), you can play with this Spring Boot application in the cloud using the following maven command to deploy it:
```
mvn clean package fabric8:deploy -Pkubernetes
```  
   
**Note**: Unfortunately, when you deploy using the fabric8 plugin, the readiness and liveness probes fail to point to the right actuator URL due a lack of support for Spring Boot. 
This push you to edit the generated deployment inside kubernetes and change these probes which points to "path": "/health" to  "path": "/actuator/health". 
This will make your deployment go green. This issue is already reported into the fabric8 community: https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/issues/1178   
   
When the application has been deployed, you can access its service or endpoint url using this command:
```   
minikube service kubernetes-hello-world --url
```
  
And next you can curl the endpoint using the url returned by the previous command

``` 
curl https://IP_OR_HOSTNAME/
```

then

``` 
curl https://IP_OR_HOSTNAME/services
```     

Should return you the list of available services discovered by the DiscoveryClient     
     
``` 
mvn clean install -Pintegration
```
