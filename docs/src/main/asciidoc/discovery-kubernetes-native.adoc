== Kubernetes native service discovery

Kubernetes itself is capable of (server side) service discovery (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#discovering-services).
Using native kubernetes service discovery ensures compatibility with additional tooling, like: istio https://istio.io (service mesh, capable of load balancing, ribbon, circuit breaker, failover and much more).

The caller service just needs to refer to names resolvable in particular kubernetes cluster then. Simplest implementation might use the spring `RestTemplate` referring to fully qualified domain name (FQDN) `http://<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.<cluster>.local:<service-port>`.

Additionally, hystrix can be used for:

* circuit breaker implementation on the caller side, just by annotating the spring boot application class: `@EnableCircuitBreaker`
* and for the fallback functionality, annotating the respective method via: `@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod=` does the job.
