== Kubernetes Ecosystem Awareness

All of the features described earlier in this guide work equally well, regardless of whether your application is running inside
Kubernetes. This is really helpful for development and troubleshooting.
From a development point of view, this lets you start your Spring Boot application and debug one
of the modules that is part of this project. You need not deploy it in Kubernetes,
as the code of the project relies on the
https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client[Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client], which is a fluent DSL that can
communicate by using `http` protocol to the REST API of the Kubernetes Server.

To disable the integration with Kubernetes you can set `spring.cloud.kubernetes.enabled` to `false`. Please be aware that when `spring-cloud-kubernetes-config` is on the classpath,
`spring.cloud.kubernetes.enabled` should be set in `bootstrap.{properties|yml}` (or the profile specific one)  otherwise it should be in `application.{properties|yml}` (or the profile specific one).
Also note that these properties: `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.enabled` and `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.enabled` only take effect when set in `bootstrap.{properties|yml}`

=== Kubernetes Profile Autoconfiguration

When the application runs as a pod inside Kubernetes, a Spring profile named `kubernetes` automatically gets activated.
This lets you customize the configuration, to define beans that are applied when the Spring Boot application is deployed
within the Kubernetes platform (for example, different development and production configuration).

=== Istio Awareness

When you include the `spring-cloud-kubernetes-fabric8-istio` module in the application classpath, a new profile is added to the application,
provided the application is running inside a Kubernetes Cluster with https://istio.io[Istio] installed. You can then use
spring `@Profile("istio")` annotations in your Beans and `@Configuration` classes.

The Istio awareness module uses  `me.snowdrop:istio-client` to interact with Istio APIs, letting us discover traffic rules, circuit breakers, and so on,
making it easy for our Spring Boot applications to consume this data to dynamically configure themselves according to the environment.
