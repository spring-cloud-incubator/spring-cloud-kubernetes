= Kubernetes PropertySource implementations

The most common approach to configure your Spring Boot application is to create an `application.properties|yaml` or
an `application-profile.properties|yaml` file containing key-value pairs providing customization values to your
application or Spring Boot starters. Users may override these properties by specifying system properties or environment
variables.

== ConfigMap PropertySource

Kubernetes provides a resource named https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/[ConfigMap] to externalize the
parameters to pass to your application in the form of key-value pairs or embedded `application.properties|yaml` files.
The link:./spring-cloud-kubernetes-config[Spring Cloud Kubernetes Config] project makes Kubernetes `ConfigMap`s available
during application bootstrapping and triggers hot reloading of beans or Spring context when changes are detected on
observed `ConfigMap`s.

The default behavior is to create a `ConfigMapPropertySource` based on a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` which has `metadata.name` of either the name of
your Spring application (as defined by its `spring.application.name` property) or a custom name defined within the
`bootstrap.properties` file under the following key `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.name`.

However, more advanced configuration are possible where multiple ConfigMaps can be used
This is made possible by the `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.sources` list.
For example one could define the following ConfigMaps

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: cloud-k8s-app
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      config:
        name: default-name
        namespace: default-namespace
        sources:
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes will lookup a ConfigMap named c1 in namespace default-namespace
         - name: c1
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes will lookup a ConfigMap named default-name in whatever namespace n2
         - namespace: n2
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes will lookup a ConfigMap named c3 in namespace n3
         - namespace: n3
           name: c3
```

In the example above, it `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.namespace` had not been set,
then the ConfigMap named `c1` would be looked up in the namespace that the application runs

Any matching `ConfigMap` that is found, will be processed as follows:

- apply individual configuration properties.
- apply as `yaml` the content of any property named `application.yaml`
- apply as properties file the content of any property named `application.properties`

The single exception to the aforementioned flow is when the `ConfigMap` contains a **single** key that indicates
the file is a YAML or Properties file. In that case the name of the key does NOT have to be `application.yaml` or
`application.properties` (it can be anything) and the value of the property will be treated correctly.
This features facilitates the use case where the `ConfigMap` was created using something like:

`kubectl create configmap game-config --from-file=/path/to/app-config.yaml`

Example:

Let's assume that we have a Spring Boot application named ``demo`` that uses properties to read its thread pool
configuration.

- `pool.size.core`
- `pool.size.maximum`

This can be externalized to config map in `yaml` format:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  pool.size.core: 1
  pool.size.max: 16
```

Individual properties work fine for most cases but sometimes embedded `yaml` is more convenient. In this case we will
use a single property named `application.yaml` to embed our `yaml`:

 ```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    pool:
      size:
        core: 1
        max:16
```

The following also works:

 ```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  custom-name.yaml: |-
    pool:
      size:
        core: 1
        max:16
```

Spring Boot applications can also be configured differently depending on active profiles which will be merged together
when the ConfigMap is read. It is possible to provide different property values for different profiles using an
`application.properties|yaml` property, specifying profile-specific values each in their own document
(indicated by the `---` sequence) as follows:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  application.yml: |-
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the World
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye
    ---
    spring:
      profiles: development
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Developers
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye to the Developers
    ---
    spring:
      profiles: production
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Ops
```

In the above case, the configuration loaded into your Spring Application with the `development` profile will be:
```yaml
  greeting:
    message: Say Hello to the Developers
  farewell:
    message: Say Goodbye to the Developers
```
whereas if the `production` profile is active, the configuration will be:
```yaml
  greeting:
    message: Say Hello to the Ops
  farewell:
    message: Say Goodbye
```

If both profiles are active, the property which appears last within the configmap will overwrite preceding values.


To tell to Spring Boot which `profile` should be enabled at bootstrap, a system property can be passed to the Java
command launching your Spring Boot application using an env variable that you will define with the OpenShift
`DeploymentConfig` or Kubernetes `ReplicationConfig` resource file as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
spec:
  replicas: 1
  ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: JAVA_APP_DIR
          value: /deployments
        - name: JAVA_OPTIONS
          value: -Dspring.profiles.active=developer
```

**Notes:**
- check the security configuration section, to access config maps from inside a pod you need to have the correct
Kubernetes service accounts, roles and role bindings.

== Secrets PropertySource

Kubernetes has the notion of [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) for storing
sensitive data such as password, OAuth tokens, etc. This project provides integration with `Secrets` to make secrets
accessible by Spring Boot applications. This feature can be explicitly enabled/disabled using the `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.enabled` property.

The `SecretsPropertySource` when enabled will lookup Kubernetes for `Secrets` from the following sources:
1. reading recursively from secrets mounts
2. named after the application (as defined by `spring.application.name`)
3. matching some labels

Please note that by default, consuming Secrets via API (points 2 and 3 above) **is not enabled** for security reasons
 and it is recommend that containers share secrets via mounted volumes.

If the secrets are found their data is made available to the application.

**Example:**

Let's assume that we have a spring boot application named ``demo`` that uses properties to read its database
configuration. We can create a Kubernetes secret using the following command:

```
oc create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=username=user --from-literal=password=p455w0rd
```

This would create the following secret (shown using `oc get secrets db-secret -o yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: cDQ1NXcwcmQ=
  username: dXNlcg==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2017-07-04T09:15:57Z
  name: db-secret
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "357496"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets/db-secret
  uid: 63c89263-6099-11e7-b3da-76d6186905a8
type: Opaque
```


Note that the data contains Base64-encoded versions of the literal provided by the create command.

This secret can then be used by your application for example by exporting the secret's value as environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ${project.artifactId}
spec:
   template:
     spec:
       containers:
         - env:
            - name: DB_USERNAME
              valueFrom:
                 secretKeyRef:
                   name: db-secret
                   key: username
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                 secretKeyRef:
                   name: db-secret
                   key: password
```

You can select the Secrets to consume in a number of ways:

1. By listing the directories where secrets are mapped:
    ```
    -Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.paths=/etc/secrets/db-secret,etc/secrets/postgresql
    ```

    If you have all the secrets mapped to a common root, you can set them like:

    ```
    -Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.paths=/etc/secrets
    ```

2. By setting a named secret:
    ```
    -Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.name=db-secret
    ```

3. By defining a list of labels:
    ```
    -Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.labels.broker=activemq
    -Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.labels.db=postgresql
    ```

|===
**Notes:**
- The property `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.labels` behaves as defined by
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-Configuration-Binding#map-based-binding[Map-based binding].
- The property `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.paths` behaves as defined by
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-Configuration-Binding#collection-based-binding[Collection-based binding].
- Access to secrets via API may be restricted for security reasons, the preferred way is to mount secret to the POD.

Example of application using secrets (though it hasn't been updated to use the new `spring-cloud-kubernetes` project):

== PropertySource Reload

Some applications may need to detect changes on external property sources and update their internal status to reflect the new configuration.
The reload feature of Spring Cloud Kubernetes is able to trigger an application reload when a related `ConfigMap` or
`Secret` changes.

This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled using the configuration property `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.enabled=true`
 (eg. in the *application.properties* file).

The following levels of reload are supported (property `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.strategy`):
- **`refresh` (default)**: only configuration beans annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties` or `@RefreshScope` are reloaded.
This reload level leverages the refresh feature of Spring Cloud Context.
- **`restart_context`**: the whole Spring _ApplicationContext_ is gracefully restarted. Beans are recreated with the new configuration.
- **`shutdown`**: the Spring _ApplicationContext_ is shut down to activate a restart of the container.
 When using this level, make sure that the lifecycle of all non-daemon threads is bound to the ApplicationContext
 and that a replication controller or replica set is configured to restart the pod.

Example:

Assuming that the reload feature is enabled with default settings (*`refresh`* mode), the following bean will be refreshed when the config map changes:

```java
@Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "bean")
public class MyConfig {

    private String message = "a message that can be changed live";

    // getter and setters

}
```

A way to see that changes effectively happen is creating another bean that prints the message periodically.

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {

    @Autowired
    private MyConfig config;

    @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5000)
    public void hello() {
        System.out.println("The message is: " + config.getMessage());
    }
}
```

The message printed by the application can be changed using a `ConfigMap` as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: reload-example
data:
  application.properties: |-
    bean.message=Hello World!
```

Any change to the property named `bean.message` in the `ConfigMap` associated to the pod will be reflected in the
output. More generally speaking, changes associated to properties prefixed with the value defined by the `prefix`
field of the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation will be detected and reflected in the application.
[Associating a `ConfigMap` to a pod](#configmap-propertysource) is explained above.

The full example is available in [spring-cloud-kubernetes-reload-example](spring-cloud-kubernetes-examples/kubernetes-reload-example).

The reload feature supports two operating modes:
- **event (default)**: watches for changes in config maps or secrets using the Kubernetes API (web socket).
Any event will produce a re-check on the configuration and a reload in case of changes.
The `view` role on the service account is required in order to listen for config map changes. A higher level role (eg. `edit`) is required for secrets
(secrets are not monitored by default).
- **polling**: re-creates the configuration periodically from config maps and secrets to see if it has changed.
The polling period can be configured using the property `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.period` and defaults to *15 seconds*.
It requires the same role as the monitored property source.
This means, for example, that using polling on file mounted secret sources does not require particular privileges.

|===
**Notes**:
- Properties under *spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.* should not be used in config maps or secrets: changing such properties at runtime may lead to unexpected results;
- Deleting a property or the whole config map does not restore the original state of the beans when using the *refresh* level.
